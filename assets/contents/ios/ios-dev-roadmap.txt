|#|Topic|Description|
|--|-----|-----------|
|1|The Swift Programming Language|Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.|
|2|Xcode|Xcode 14 includes everything you need to develop, test, and distribute apps across all Apple platforms.|
|3|App Architecture|The structure of the project.|
|4|Version Control|**AKA**: revision control, source control, source control managment|
|5|Media|Image, Video, Text, Voice|
|6|Network|Communicate with backend: http, https, web socket|
|7|Modularization|Activity of dividing a product or system into interchangeable modules|
|8|Framework|An essential supporting structure which other things are built on top of|
|9|Debug|Tools and techniques used to find and resolve bugs and issues|
|10|Coding Convention && Best Practices|A set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language|
|11|Testing && CI/CD|Tools and techniques for testing iOS App|
|12|UIKit|Construct and manage a graphical, event-driven user interface for your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS app.|
|13|SwiftUI|SwiftUI helps you build great-looking apps across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift â€” and surprisingly little code.|
|14|Concurrency|Multiple computations are happening at the same time|
|15|iOS Dev Alternative Platforms|C++, Xamarin(.Net), Python (PyMob, Kivy), React Native|
|16|Security|Protection from, or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercive change) caused by others, by restraining the freedom of others to act|
|17|Protocol|**AKA**: Interface Type is a data type describing a set of method signatures, the implementations of which may be provided by multiple classes that are otherwise not necessarily related to each other.|
|18|Memory and Storage|Memory is what your computer uses to store data temporarily, while storage is where you save files permanently|
|19|Form and Validation|Form submission, Regex|
|20|Navigation|Getting users where they want to go, with the least amount of friction possible|
|21|State Management|The implementation of a Design Pattern, with the help of this design pattern we can synchronize the state of the application throughout all components of the application|
|22|Machine Learning and VR|A type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so|
|23|Tips and Common Issues|Some iOS development tips|
|24|Animation|A method by which still figures are manipulated to appear as moving images|
|25|Combine|Combine declares publishers to expose values that can change over time, and subscribers to receive those values from the publishers.|
|26|Dependency Management|A technique for declaring, resolving and using dependencies required by the project in an automated fashion.|
|27|The Objective-C Programming Language|A general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language|
