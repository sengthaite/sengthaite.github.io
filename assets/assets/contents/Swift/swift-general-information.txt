## Definition

> **Swift** is general-purpose programming language built using *modern approach to safety*, *performance*, and *software design patterns*.

## Modern approach to safety:

+ Variables are always initialized before use
+ Arrays and integers are checked for overflow
+ Memory is managed automatically
+ Easy to understand syntax. e.g. var (variable) or let (constant)
+ Swift object can never be nil. Provide the optional operator to handle nil *(?).* It is check in compile time so code is much cleaner and safer in runtime.
+ Always in-progress expressive programming language to bring the modern features developer expected.

## Performance:

+ Intended as a replacement for C-based language (C, C++, and Objective-C)
+ Performance must be predictable and consistent, not just fast in short bursts that require clean-up later.

## Software design patterns

* Singleton
* MVC
* Delegation pattern
* Builder pattern (result builder pattern)

## Swift Features:

- type inference
- modules eliminate headers and provide namespaces
- automatic memory management
- no need semi-colons
- named parameter
- closure unified with function pointers
- tuples and multiple return values
- generics 
- fast and concise iteration over a range or collection
- structs that support methods, extensions, and protocols
- functional programming patterns. e.g. map and filter
- built-in error handling
- advanced control flow: do, guard, defer, and repeat

## Swift is an open source project since **03rd December 2015**

## Goals:

Best available languages uses ranging from systems programming, mobile and desktop apps, to cloud services.

## Supported platforms:

- Apple platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS
- Linux and android
- Windows
